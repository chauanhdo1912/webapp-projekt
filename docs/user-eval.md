### Meta

Status
: **Work in progress** - Done - Obsolete

Updated
: DD-MMM-YYYY

### Goal

"How long does it take to bild the Datenbank for user information and the data from the Post-Seite to show it up on Feed-Seite?"

### Method

We need to combine two tables from Datenbank users and post to an all-together db: users.db

### Results

It keeps the code shorter and cleanser, so that we can put all the datas together on the same file and it useful for data management.

### Implications

Learn to use the SQL Lite + SQL Alchelmy, also the migrate-part for changing the datas after setting them on the beginning.
